## ‚≠ê [Project Overview](#toc)

The Bash Bits ANSI Module - colour and style codes for ANSI terminals.  This module contains not only all of the colour and style definitions to help make Bash-Bits attractive and fun to work with, it provides some of the more common "quality of life" enhancements to make every day with Bash-Bits that much easier.

### [Branch Reliability](#toc)

The Branch Reliability Table is a way for you to determine how close to the bleeding edge you're comfortable getting.

If you need stability, then download a branch marked with üü¢

If you're contributing code to the project, you'll want üî¥

| Branch               |    Stability    | Code Age         | Reliability |
|----------------------|:---------------:|------------------|:-----------:|
| `master`             |  latest stable  | latest release   |     üü¢      |
| `develop`            | latest unstable | most recent code |     üî¥      |

## üìÇ [Installation](#toc)

Like ALL other Bash-Bits Modules, BB-ANSI is "imported" using the [BB-Import Module](https://github.com/bash-bits/bb-import).  If you haven't yet installed BB-Import, perhaps you'd like to do so now?  It's as easy as running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
bash <(curl -sfLS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bash-bits/bb-import/master/install.sh)
```

Once you've installed `BB-Import`, you can include BB-ANSI in ANY of your Bash projects by including the following code snippet at the top of each file:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bb-import

bb::import bb-ansi
```

## üëç [Supporting the Project](#toc)

The creation and maintenance of Open Source Software is definitely a labour of love - this is never going to be a path to riches.  The truth is, it takes not only a lot of time, it creates a substantial amount of personal expense (even when you're working on a shoestring) to keep these projects freely available for all.

If this project is worth something to you, and you're in a position to be able to help out financially, it would <strong>really</strong> take the pressure off here and allow me to keep working and keep it all freely available!

It doesn't have to be a lot, but you will magnify your contribution if you're able to give a little every month.  If you're not in a position to do that, but think you could make a small, one-time donation to the kitty - you'd be AMAZED how I can make a little go a LONG way!

EVERY financial supporter gets their name associated with the project.
